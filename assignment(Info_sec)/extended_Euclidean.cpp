    TOPIC : Extended Euclidean Algorithm

    Definition: The extended Euclidean algorithm is an extension to the Euclidean
    algorithm, and computes, in addition to the greatest common divisor (gcd) of
    integers a and b, also the coefficients of Bezoutâ€™s identity, which are integers 
    x and y such that
    ax + by = gcd(a,b)
    Ex. Input: a=30, b=20;
        Output: gcd=10, x=1, y=-1;
        (such that 30*1+20*(-1) = 10).*/

        *y = 1; 
        return b; 
    } 

    int x1, y1; // To store results of recursive call 
    int gcd = gcdExtended(b%a, a, &x1, &y1); 

    // Update x and y using results of 
    // recursive call 
    *x = y1 - (b/a) * x1; 
    *y = x1;
